"â€”<b>PO Zf</b> unpublished. During emergency excavations carried out by N. Dimopoulou a
gold ring with an inscription appeared in a hue from the Neopalatial era. The
site had already yielded an inscription painted on a clay statuette. The ring
is therefore to be named PO Zf 2. This is the second inscription incised on the
circular bezel of a ring, after that of Mavrospilio (KN Zf 13). The object,
which is very small (6 mm in diameter), will be published jointly by N. Dimopoulou
and J. P. Olivier. The inscription is formed by the sequence AB 69-39-59
(hapax) which runs from left to right along the edge of the bezel."
